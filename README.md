## Leaderboards
A project for ranking users based on application data collected via APIs. Currently integrated with instragram API.


## Debugging
*Just a general note, if the program ever throws an error saying:
Error: Cannot find module <XXX>
just run the command
npm install <XXX>

Run from main directory with: 
```
npm start 
```

# Build to 'build' directory (it's ignored by git, see .gitignore)

```
npm run build
```

# Start the express.js app

```
node server
```

Check out Nodemon later for restarting server when new content is posted...



## Run mysql server
To run mysql

```
mysql.server start
sudo mysql -p 
 Treehouse!1
```
